                        <h3>Numpy</h3>
                        <p>Numpy is a useful module in python that allows the use of a wide variety of mathematical functions. 
                            For machine learning, the method <i>numpy.array()</i> is very useful, as we can instantiate matrices
                            with it. To do matrix operations, there are methods such as <i>numpy.dot()</i>, which allows us to 
                            compute the dot product of two matrices.

                        <p>
                        If we use optimisation to find good classification values in linear regression, it's difficult to obtain a level of certainty. 
                        This is because the linear loss function that gives values of either 1 or 0 is not helpful when data is not linearly seperable.
                        When data is not linearly seperable, we could have two classifiers that misclassify the same number of values, but one is 
                        better than the other. When we use optimisation to find a good model, it will be very difficult to find them as two similar models
                        will not be close to each other on the graph of loss functions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Instead, we can use linear logistic regression (LLC), or just logistic regression for short. This is a classification algorithmm that
                        gives a probability for a loss function, instead of a binary 1 or 0. Therefore, better models will have a higher probability of being
                        useful. This uses a sigmoid function instead of a sign function. In prediction, we will predict +1 if the sigmoid function of our
                        theta(s) and theta 0 is above some threshold value e.g. 0.5
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        To train this data, we need to use a new loss function. This is called the <b>negative log likelihood loss function</b>.
